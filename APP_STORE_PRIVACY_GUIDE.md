## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Mark photos/memory text as "Linked to User"**
   - These are sent to Google Gemini WITHOUT user ID
   - Mark as "Not Linked to User"

2. **Say you collect Device ID**
   - You do NOT collect IDFA, IDFV, or other tracking identifiers
   - Only collect User ID (from Supabase auth)

3. **Mark any data as "Used for Tracking"**
   - This would trigger ATT prompt
   - You genuinely don't track users

4. **Forget to list third-party SDKs**
   - Apple can detect SDKs in your binary
   - Be transparent about Supabase, RevenueCat, Google Gemini

5. **Use generic privacy policy**
   - Your policy must be specific to MemorySparks
   - Include all third parties and data types

## 🎯 SECTION 13: Key Talking Points for App Review

If Apple requests clarification during review, use these points:

### **Why we send data to Google Gemini AI:**
"We use Google Gemini AI to generate personalized stories from user memories. The memory text and optional images are sent to Google's API for processing. We do NOT send personally identifiable information (email, name, user ID) with these requests. This is clearly disclosed in our Privacy Policy Section 4.1."

### **Why photos are "Not Linked to User":**
"Photos uploaded by users are processed locally, then sent to Google Gemini AI for image analysis without any user identifiers. The photos are not stored on our servers and are not linked to the user's account."

### **Why we don't collect analytics:**
"We prioritize user privacy and have intentionally chosen NOT to implement analytics SDKs (Firebase, Amplitude, etc.) or crash reporting tools. We only collect the minimum data necessary to provide our core service: AI story generation and subscription management."

### **How users can delete their data:**
"Users can request account deletion by emailing hansleonel@icloud.com. We delete all account data from Supabase within 30 days. Local stories remain on the user's device until they delete the app. This process is documented in Privacy Policy Section 13.2."
